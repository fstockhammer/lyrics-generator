# Lumos Lyrics Generator

Internal Lumos project ("S-Case") to build an AI text generator based on a LSTM architecture to write songs with flexible user inputs.

Project features include:
- functions to download song lyrics using the Genius API
- functions to download song characterisctics from Spotify API
- generate song lyrics from user input with words that are not necessarily in the vocabulary of the model
- several rhyming patterns are implemented

To use the notebooks, unzip *data.zip* and *model.zip*. The model should be in the same directory as the notebooks, the data in a folder called data.
